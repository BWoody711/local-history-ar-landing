            <h3>What is this study about?</h3>
            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that plots virtual objects in the real world. AR has been adopted by many museums
                and heritage organizations in Europe to communicate information about history and architecture, but it is used less often
                for this purpose in North America. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent advances in AR technology now allow for web-based AR applications that do not
                require you to download an app on your phone. This has made AR applications easier to both develop and use, further 
                improving the potential of AR to communicate local history and built heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this study, we developed a web-based AR application called <b>Local History AR</b>. Local History AR allows
                you to point your phone at a historic building to learn about its history and architecture, and view old photographs depicting 
                that building. In this study, we hope to assess the usefulness of AR as a tool for communicating information about historical
                buildings by having interested people like you test out our new application.

        <h3>How do I participate?</h3>
            <p>Participating in this study involves three steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete an entrance survey to tell us a little bit about yourself and your 
                    current level of interest in local history and built heritage. <b>You do not need to have any prior interest in history or built heritage to participate in this study!</b></li>
                <li>Spend 15-20 minutes using the Local History AR web application on your phone or tablet!
                    Within the application, you will be given <b> a scavenger hunt with 6 clues</b> to answer about Bayfield or New Hamburg's
                    historic buildings. You can attempt to answer as many or as few of these questions as you would like.
                </li>
                <li>Complete an exit survey to tell us about your experience using the Local History AR application.
                </li>
            </ol>
                <p>This study must be completed on a mobile device (i.e. a phone or tablet).</p>
                <p>Since Local History AR is a web application, you will not be required to download any software to your device. 
                However, you will need access to the internet (either through WiFi or mobile data) throughout the activity.</p>
                <p>This study must be completed in either Bayfield or New Hamburg.</p>

        <h3>How do I use the Local History AR app?</h3>
            <p>Using the Local History AR app is as simple as pointing your phone at a historic building of interest.
                If that building is in our database, it will show up as a white sphere in the virtual scene. It may take up to 20 seconds for the app to load all of the buildings in the virtual scene.
                If that building is the closest building to you that is in front of your phone, it will be highlighted in cyan. This may take a few seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                To learn more about buildings highlighted in cyan, click on the "Description" button on the bottom left of the application. Here, you can read historical and architectural descriptions about the building.
                To view historical images of the building (if available), you can click on the "Images" button on the bottom centre of the application. If images are available for the selected building, these will pop up automatically.
                To view the clues for the scavenger hunt, click on the "Points of Interest" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done using the Local History AR application and wish to proceed to the exit survey, click on the "Points of Interest" button, and then the "Proceed to Exit Survey" button.
                <b>Be sure to complete the exit survey once you are finished using the application!</b>
            </p>

            <h3>What data is collected and what will it be used for?</h3>
            <p>Only your responses to the entrance and exit survey are recorded as part of this study. 
            While the Local History AR application uses your device's GPS and camera to plot buildings
            in the virtual scene, <b>the application does NOT collect any location or video data.</b></p>
            <p>Data collected from the entrance and exit surveys may be used in research papers and/or presentations about the usefulness 
                of augmented reality (AR) for communicating local history and built heritage.</p>
