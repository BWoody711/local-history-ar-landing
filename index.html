            <h3>What is this study about?</h3>
            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that plots virtual objects in the real world. AR  has been adopted by many museums and heritage organizations in Europe to share information about history and architecture, but it is used less often in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this study, we developed an AR application called <b>Local History AR</b> that lets you to point your phone at a historic building and see information about its history and architecture in your camera’s view.  We would like your help in testing Local History AR and evaluating how useful AR is to share information about historical buildings.

        <h3>How do I participate?</h3>
            <p>Participating in this study involves three steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete an entrance survey to tell us a little bit about yourself and your 
                    interest in local history and built heritage. <b>You do not need to have any prior interest in history or built heritage to participate in this study!</b></li>
                <li>Spend 15-20 minutes using the Local History AR web-app on your phone or tablet!
                    Within the app, you will be given <b> a scavenger hunt with 6 clues</b> to answer about Bayfield or New Hamburg's
                    historic buildings. You can answer as many of these questions as you like.
                </li>
                <li>Complete an exit survey to tell us about your experience using the Local History AR application.
                </li>
            </ol>
                <p>This study must be completed on a mobile phone or tablet and you must use it in the historic cores of Bayfield or New Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Since Local History AR is web-based, it runs in your phone’s browser (e.g,. Google Chrome, Safari) and does not require you to install any software on your phone.  However, you will need access to the internet (either through WiFi or mobile data) throughout the activity.</p>
            </p>

        <h3>How do I use the Local History AR app?</h3>
            <p>
                Using the Local History AR app is as simple as pointing your phone at a historic building in Bayfield’s or New Hamburg’s core. If that building is in our database, a white sphere will appear on top of the building in your camera’s view.  It may take up to 20 seconds for the app to load all the buildings in the virtual scene. If that building is the closest building to you that is in front of your phone, it will be highlighted in cyan. This may take a few seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                To learn more about buildings highlighted in cyan, click on the "Description" button on the bottom left of the application. Here, you can read historical and architectural descriptions about the building. If historical images of the building are available, you can see them by clicking on the "Images" button on the bottom centre of the app. If images are available for the selected building, these will pop up automatically. To view the clues for the scavenger hunt, click on the "Points of Interest"  button.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done using the Local History AR app and want to complete the exit survey, click on the "Points of Interest" button, and then the "Proceed to Exit Survey" button.
                <b>Please be sure to complete the exit survey once you are finished using the application!</b>
            </p>

            <h3>What data is collected and what will it be used for?</h3>
            <p>Only your responses to the entrance and exit survey are recorded as part of this study. While the Local History AR application uses your device's GPS and camera to plot buildings in the virtual scene, 
            <b>the application does NOT collect any personal information, including camera views, and location or video data.</b></p>
            <p>Data collected from the entrance and exit surveys may be used in research papers and/or presentations about the usefulness 
                of augmented reality (AR) for communicating local history and built heritage.</p>
