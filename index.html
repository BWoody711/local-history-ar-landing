            <h3>What is this study about?</h3>
            <p>Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that plots virtual objects in the real world. We developed <b>Local History AR</b> – an app that lets you point your phone at a historic building and see information about it in your camera’s view.  We would like your help in testing Local History AR and evaluating how useful AR is to share information about historic buildings.
            </p>

        <h3>How do I participate?</h3>
            <p>Participating in this study involves 3 steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tell us a little bit about yourself in a short entrance survey. <b>No personal information will be requested and no prior interest in history or built heritage is needed to participate.</b></li>
                <li>Use the Local History AR web-app on your phone for 15-20 minutes. There is a <b> a scavenger hunt with 6 clues</b> in the app to answer about Bayfield’s or New Hamburg's historic buildings. Answer as many questions as you like.
                </li>
                <li>Tell us your thoughts about the Local History AR in a short exit survey. 
                </li>
            </ol>
                <p>This study must be completed on a mobile phone in the historic core of Bayfield or New Hamburg.</p>
                <p>Since Local History AR is web-based, it runs in your phone’s browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Safari) and no software installation is required. You will need access to the internet via WiFi (preferred) or mobile data throughout the activity.</p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
        <h3>How do I use Local History AR?</h3>
            <p>
                It’s simple - just point your phone at a historic building in Bayfield’s or New Hamburg’s core. If the building is in our database , a white sphere will appear on the building in your camera’s view. It may take 15-20 seconds for the app to load all the buildings in the virtual scene. If that building is the closest building to you that is in front of your phone, it will be highlighted in cyan. This may take a few seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tap on "Description" in the bottom left of the app to see the building’s historical and architectural information. Some buildings also have historical photos that can be seen by tapping on "Images".  To view the clues for the scavenger hunt, tap on the "Scavenger Hunt" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done using Local History AR, tap on "Scavenger Hunt", and then the "Proceed to Exit Survey" button. 
                <b>Please complete the exit survey once you are finished using the app!</b>
            </p>

            <h3>What data is collected and what will it be used for?</h3>
            <p>Only your entrance and exit survey responses are recorded for this study. While Local History AR uses your phone's GPS and camera to plot buildings, 
            <b>it <u>does not</u> collect any personal information, including camera views, or location or video data.</b></p>
            <p>Data from the surveys may be used in research papers and/or presentations about the usefulness of augmented reality (AR) for communicating local history and built heritage.</p>
